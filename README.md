# Astroport Token Lists

### How to Add a Token

1. Fork this repo
2. Add the token details in an existing token list under [tokenLists](/tokenLists). If there is a brand new Astroport deployment on a chain that's not already tracked in this repo, create a new list with the name `chainName.json`
3. Add or refer to a token logo in [img](/img) when filling out the `logo` field for a token in a list. If you add a new logo, make sure you use PNG or PNG and SVG versions. Each logo should be saved in a subdir at `/img/TOKEN_SYMBOL/` and resolution shouldn't be higher than 350x350
4. Create a PR with your changes once you're done
